					MoreGDT is a large Game Dev Tycoon mod that aims to greatly increase the amount of products in-game so you can develop for your favourite platforms and continue to make games for newer platforms beyond those that the game includes as standard. A whole range of new manufacturers have been added like Voogle and Atira, as well as additions to manufacturers already included in the game. 
				</p>
				<p class="left-align flow-text">
					Not only that, but there is also a new set of research choices and topics you can choose from as well as an all new Vindows storyline which shows you the improvements made to the PC platform as you progress through the game. 
				</p>
				<p class="left-align flow-text">
					As standard, this each build of this project can be found on our Github repository. If you decide that you want to base your own work off one of these builds then you are welcome to do so as long as you give us credit somewhere along the lines like the nice person that you are, then we'll all be happy.
				</p>
				<p class="left-align flow-text">
					<b class="blue-text">
						If you are a 3D artist, or just so happen to be good at in general, then please get in touch with us through Steam! We need someone who can help out with the product icons.

				As mentioned, these releases can be downloaded from our Github page. Older versions, as you would expect, are quite buggy and may not be compatible with any other mods that you have installed and since they are older they will not be made compatible unless you do it yourself. Release Candidate builds are designed to show what the final product will look like before the main stable release, most features will be completed throughout these builds so please provide feedback on anything you wish to be changed or anything that doesn't work. Thank you for your co-operation!
